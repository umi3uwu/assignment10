Exercise-6: Function Composition
Write a function "compose(*funcs)" that takes a series of functions and returns a new function that composes them. The returned function should take an input and apply each function to the result of the previous function.

Exercise-7: Partial Application
Write a function "partial(func, *args)" that implements partial application. The function should return a new function that when called will return the result of applying the input function to the provided arguments, followed by the new arguments.

Exercise-9: Function Memoization
Write a function "memoize(func)" that takes a function and returns a memoized version of the function. The memoized version should cache the results of the function so that the next time it's called with the same arguments, it returns the cached value instead of calculating the result again.
